openPMD front-end for yt-project.org
====================================

This is a draft of a HDF5 reader implementation for openPMD
in yt-project.org

Some sizes are still fixed to our example data sets and particlePatch
supports needs to be added for parallel data processing.

If you are a python hacker, you might enjoy the current draft and feel
free to contribute :)
